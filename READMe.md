About:

This is a personal project I am undertaking on a button clicker that will generate random colors.

This will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The youtube video for the tutorial I used is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCH8EA55js&list=PLtMugc7g4GaqAVDZwQ_t1H6500ZGJzOgW&index=2

Below I will place 'Eurekas' which are takeaways from the project.
