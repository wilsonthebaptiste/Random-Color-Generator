About:

This is a personal project I am undertaking on a button clicker that will generate random colors.

This will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The youtube video for the tutorial I used is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCH8EA55js&list=PLtMugc7g4GaqAVDZwQ_t1H6500ZGJzOgW&index=2

Below I will place 'Eurekas' which are takeaways from the project.

Eurekas
1.The span tag in HTML is used to color a specific part of text in the markup
2.You can use text-transform in css to change the nature of text ie; make it all uppercase
3.Did not know you could add text animations in css. Need to specify the code of the animation using @keyframes
4.@media can be used in css to change the style based on the media/device being used
